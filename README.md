Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

Develop a credit scoring model to predict the
creditworthiness of individuals based on historical
financial data. Utilize classification algorithms and
assess the model's accuracy.

Task 2: Emotion Recognition from Speech

Build a model that can recognize emotions in speech
audio. Use deep learning and speech processing
techniques to classify spoken sentences into different
emotions like happiness, anger, or sadness.

Task 3: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

Create a model to predict the likelihood of a disease
based on medical data (e.g., symptoms, patient
history). Use datasets with labeled medical records and
apply classification algorithms.
